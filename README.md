# 3D_structure_from_motion
***Description:*** Collaborated with a partner to develop a simple Structure from Motion pipeline as part of a university assignment. The goal of the project was to estimate the 3D structure of a small scene captured by a smartphone from a sequence of images with some field of view overlaps.

#### Key Accomplishments:

- Developed expertise in feature extraction and matching, essential matrix and homography computation, and Ceres Solver problem implementation.
- Completed two code portions in features_matcher.cpp to extract salient points, descriptors, and features colors from images and match descriptors between images using Essential + Homography geometric verification.
- Completed three code portions in basic_sfm.cpp to extract both Essential matrix E and Homography matrix H, add a residual block inside a Ceres Solver problem, and implement an auto-differentiable cost function for the Ceres Solver problem.
- Collaborated effectively with partner to produce a single submission for the assignment.

***Skills:*** C++, Structure from Motion, feature extraction and matching, essential matrix and homography computation, Ceres Solver problem implementation.

This project demonstrated my proficiency in computer vision and provided me with valuable experience in industry-standard tools and techniques. It also highlighted my ability to work effectively in a team environment and my strong problem-solving and critical thinking skills.
